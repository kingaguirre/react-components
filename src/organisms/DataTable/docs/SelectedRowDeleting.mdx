# Selected Row Deleting

Selected row deleting allows you to remove only the rows that have been selected by the user.

## How Selected Row Deleting Works

When enabled via the `enableSelectedRowDeleting` prop, the table provides an option to delete only the selected rows.

## Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement selected row deleting in the DataTable component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { DataTable } from 'react-components-lib';

export const SelectedRowDeletingDemo = () => (
  <DataTable
    dataSource={[
      { id: "1", firstName: "John", lastname: "Doe" }
    ]}
    columnSettings={[
      { title: "ID", column: "id" },
      { title: "First Name", column: "firstName" },
      { title: "Last Name", column: "lastname" }
    ]}
    enableSelectedRowDeleting
  />
);
```
