# Cell Editing with Zod Validation

In the DataTable component, the cell editing feature leverages Zod for input validation. In the configuration, you'll notice that each column's editor can include a validation function. In these functions, the parameter `v` represents a **Zod** validation instance. 

## How It Works

- **Zod Instance (`v`)**: The `v` parameter is a ready-to-use Zod instance that you can utilize to define your validation schema.
- **Schema Definition**: You can use Zod methods to specify the expected data type and constraints. For example, you might ensure that a string is not empty, or that a number falls within a certain range.
- **Flexibility**: The approach allows you to easily integrate various validation rules, such as ensuring the presence of a value, setting minimum lengths, or even applying more complex validations, all using Zod's robust API.

## Customizing Your Validation

Zod supports a wide range of validations for different data types. Whether you need to validate strings, numbers, arrays, or even complex objects, you can configure your rules with Zod's expressive methods.

```tsx
// 1. String: Required, with a maximum length and a regex pattern.
//    - The string must be non-empty, no longer than 100 characters, and only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
const stringRequiredMaxPattern = (v) =>
  v.string()
    .min(1, "This field is required.")
    .max(100, "Maximum length is 100 characters.")
    .regex(/^[A-Za-z0-9\s]+$/, "Only alphanumeric characters and spaces are allowed.");

// 2. String: Letters only with an exact number of characters.
//    - The string must contain only letters and be exactly 5 characters long.
const lettersOnlyExactLength = (v) =>
  v.string()
    .regex(/^[A-Za-z]+$/, "Only letters are allowed.")
    .length(5, "Must be exactly 5 characters long.");

// 3. Number: With minimum and maximum value constraints.
//    - The number must be between 10 and 100 (inclusive).
const numberMinMax = (v) =>
  v.number()
    .min(10, "Minimum value is 10.")
    .max(100, "Maximum value is 100.");

// 4. Additional examples:

// Email validation:
//    - Ensures the input is a valid email address.
const emailValidation = (v) =>
  v.string()
    .email("Invalid email address.");

// URL validation:
//    - Ensures the input is a valid URL.
const urlValidation = (v) =>
  v.string()
    .url("Invalid URL.");

// Password validation (as an extra example):
//    - The password must be at least 8 characters long and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
const passwordValidation = (v) =>
  v.string()
    .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters long.")
    .regex(/(?=.*[a-z])/, "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.")
    .regex(/(?=.*[A-Z])/, "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.")
    .regex(/(?=.*\d)/, "Password must contain at least one number.");

```
