# Active Row

The active row indicates the current row in focus, often highlighted for better context.  
This is managed using the `activeRow` prop.

## How Active Row Works

Set the `activeRow` prop with the key of the row that should be active.  
This helps in scenarios where you want to emphasize or take action on a specific row.

## Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement an active row in the DataTable component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { DataTable } from 'react-components-lib';

export const ActiveRowDemo = () => (
  <DataTable
    dataSource={[
      { id: "1", firstName: "John", lastname: "Doe" },
      { id: "2", firstName: "Jane", lastname: "Smith" },
      { id: "3", firstName: "Alice", lastname: "Johnson" }
    ]}
    columnSettings={[
      { title: "ID", column: "id" },
      { title: "First Name", column: "firstName" },
      { title: "Last Name", column: "lastname" }
    ]}
    activeRow="2"
  />
);
```
