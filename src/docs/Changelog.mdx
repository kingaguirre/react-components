## üöÄ New PoC Component ‚Äì v{pkg.version}
We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new proof-of-concept component that expands the capabilities of **react-components-lib**.

### üöß Experimental
- **FormRender (PoC):**  
  The **FormRender** component is designed to **dynamically generate and render forms** from structured configuration rather than static markup. This makes it easier to:
  - Centralize form logic in one place.
  - Reduce repetitive boilerplate code.
  - Improve maintainability for complex, data-driven forms.  

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beta Notice:** FormRender is currently in **beta** and intended for early testing. It may not cover all use cases and can evolve significantly in upcoming releases.  
  If you find issues or have suggestions, please share feedback with **emmanuel.arguellesaguirre@sc.com**.
